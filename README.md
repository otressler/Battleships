Placement phase:

Place your battleships on the battlefield by entering coordinates when prompted. Coordinates during placement have the following format: [A-J][0-9][V|!V]. The letter defines the position on the x-Axis, while the number defines the position on the y-Axis. V indicates, that the ship should be placed vertically, giving a different character places the ship horizontally.

Guess phase:

Enter coordinates [A-J][0-9] when prompted. After all of the opponents ships are sunk, you win the game. However, if you are player 0 and the opponent manages to destroy your last ship after you destroyed all of his, the game is a tie.
